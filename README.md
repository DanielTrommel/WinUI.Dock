# WinUI.Dock

WinUI.Dock is a docking control similar to Visual Studio, based on WinUI 3. Its design is inspired by [AvalonDock](https://github.com/Dirkster99/AvalonDock) and [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).

## Supported Platforms
- [x] WinUI 3.0
- [x] Uno Platform (partially available)

## Usage
- See the example projects under the Examples directory.

## Notes
- The project is currently in an early stage and may have many issues. Please do not use it in production environments.
- The Uno Platform has only been tested on the Skia platform and does not support cross-window dragging. It works properly if used within a single window.
